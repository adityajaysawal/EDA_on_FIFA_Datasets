**Exploratory Data Analysis on FIFA Datasets**

The EDA was conducted on FIFA datasets to gain insights into player attributes, team strategies, and match outcomes, with a focus on analyzing performance in knockout vs non-knockout matches. The analysis covered the following aspects:

1. **Data Cleaning**: Addressed missing values, corrected data types, and removed inconsistencies to ensure data accuracy.

2. **Descriptive Statistics**: Summarized key player attributes such as pace, shooting, defending, and physicality to understand player profiles.

3. **Team Strategy in Knockout vs Non-Knockout Matches**:  
   - Analyzed the playing strategy of different teams by comparing performance metrics (like possession, shots on target, defensive tactics) in knockout and non-knockout stages.  
   - Identified whether teams adopt more defensive or offensive strategies in high-pressure knockout games, compared to the more relaxed group-stage matches.

4. **Probability of Winning Knockout Matches**:  
   - Calculated the probability of a team winning knockout matches based on historical data.  
   - Used past performances to create a probabilistic model, factoring in variables like goal difference, player experience, and team strength.

5. **Year-wise Participation of Teams**:  
   - Explored which teams participated in specific years of the FIFA World Cup.  
   - Highlighted the frequency of participation for top-performing countries like Brazil, Germany, and Argentina.

6. **Countryâ€™s Performance as Winner, Runner-up, and Second Runner-up**:  
   - Analyzed how many times a particular country became the FIFA World Cup winner, first runner-up, or second runner-up.  
   - Tracked countries with consistent top-tier performances (e.g., Brazil, France, Germany) and highlighted their success over different World Cup editions.

7. **Visualizations**:  
   - Utilized heatmaps, bar charts, and trend lines to visualize team performance trends and success rates in knockout stages.  
   - Used pie charts to display the distribution of winners, runners-up, and third-place teams across different World Cups.

This analysis helped uncover deeper insights into how teams perform under high-pressure situations, patterns of consistent success among certain nations, and historical participation trends in FIFA World Cups.
